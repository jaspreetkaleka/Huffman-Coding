Jack and Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down and broke his crown
And Jill came tumbling after.

Up Jack got and home he ran,
As fast as he could caper.
There his mother bound his head,
With vinegar and brown paper.

Jill came in and she did grin
To see his paper plaster.
Mother vexed did whip her next
For laughing at Jack's disaster.

Now Jack did laugh and Jill did cry
But her tears did soon abate.
Then Jill did say that they should play
At see-saw across the gate.
